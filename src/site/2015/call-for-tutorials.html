<h1 id="cufp-2015-call-for-tutorials">CUFP 2015 Call for Tutorials</h1>
<p>Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is an annual meeting co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming which this year will take place in Vancouver, Canada on 3-5 September 2015. CUFP aims to bridge the gap between academia and users applying functional programming in practice. CUFP provides high-quality practical tutorials covering state-of-the-art techniques and tools for functional programming. There will be a mix of tutorials on introduction and advanced level, such that anyone that wants to learn something new has an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>We are seeking proposals for half-day tutorials to be presented during the first two days of the meeting, 3 and 4 September. Submission deadline is April 30th, but the earlier you submit, the better!</p>
<p>Among the suggested topics for tutorials are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introductions to functional programming languages. In the past we have had introductions to Clojure, Erlang, F#, Haskell, ML, OCaml, Scala, Scheme, Agda, Idris and others.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying functional programming in particular areas, including the web, high-performance computing, finance.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools and techniques supporting state of the art functional programming. In the past we have had tutorials on QuickCheck, Elm and others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tutorial proposals should address the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Title</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract (about 200 words) including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tutorial Objectives: by the end of this tutorial you will be able to …</p></li>
<li><p>Intended audience: e.g. beginners, those with a working knowledge of X, …</p></li>
<li><p>Speaker Bio: Joe Bloggs is ...</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure required: For example, will participants need access to a particular system? Do they need to download anything prior to the tutorial? Can they be expected to have this on a laptop, or does it need to be provided by the meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>Other minor information which will help us market your tutorial.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As it is the norm at Scientific Conferences, usually it is expected for tutors to pay tuition fees. That being said, we value tutors time and effort and we want to reward you accordingly.</p>
<p>For CUFP tutorials, we want speakers to have free access, after all, you already contribute by holding a tutorial. Therefore, we created the following rules:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When 5 or more people register for your tutorial, you get admission to CUFP for free (2 days of tutorials, plus workshop day). If your tutorial is, against all odds, not attracting 5 participants, we reserve the right to cancel it.</p></li>
<li><p>When 10 or more people register for your tutorial, you get a $250 voucher that you can use to register for any of the other ICFP events, including ICFP itself.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Tutorials should be submitted using the following <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cufp2015">talk submission form</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, email Thomas Arts: thomas dot arts at quviq dot com or Román González: romanandreg at gmail dot com</p>
<p>The 2015 conference is in Vancouver, Canada from September 3rd-5th. Once again, it is co-located with <a href="http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/">ICFP 2015</a>.</p>
