<h1 id="cufp-2015-call-for-tutorials">CUFP 2015 Call for Tutorials</h1>
<p>Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is an annual meeting co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming which this year will take place in Vancouver, Canada on 3-5 September 2015. CUFP aims to bridge the gap between academia and users applying functional programming in practice. CUFP provides high-quality practical tutorials covering state-of-the-art techniques and tools for functional programming. There will be a mix of tutorials on introduction and advanced level, such that anyone that wants to learn something new has an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>We are seeking proposals for half-day tutorials to be presented during the first two days of the meeting, 3 and 4 September. Submission deadline is April 30th, but the earlier you submit, the better!</p>
<p>Among the suggested topics for tutorials are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introductions to functional programming languages. In the past we have had introductions to Clojure, Erlang, F#, Haskell, ML, OCaml, Scala, Scheme, Agda, Idris and others.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying functional programming in particular areas, including the web, high-performance computing, finance.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools and techniques supporting state of the art functional programming. In the past we have had tutorials on QuickCheck, Elm and others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tutorial proposals should address the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Title</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract (about 200 words) including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tutorial Objectives: by the end of this tutorial you will be able to …</p></li>
<li><p>Intended audience: e.g. beginners, those with a working knowledge of X, …</p></li>
<li><p>Speaker Bio: Joe Bloggs is ...</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure required: For example, will participants need access to a particular system? Do they need to download anything prior to the tutorial? Can they be expected to have this on a laptop, or does it need to be provided by the meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>Other minor information which will help us market your tutorial.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Tutorials should be submitted using the following <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cufp2015">talk submission form</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, email Thomas Arts: thomas dot arts at quviq dot com or Román González: romanandreg at gmail dot com</p>
